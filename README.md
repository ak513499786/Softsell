# SoftSell

SoftSell is a responsive, AI-driven customer support widget designed for license resale websites. It is meant to assist users in receiving immediate answers to typical questions such as license transfers, purchase requests, or legalities â€” all via a minimalist, intuitive chat interface.

- Typing simulation for better user experience.

### Predefined FAQ Buttons
- Predefined buttons to launch most frequently asked questions such as:

- Simulated user input with one-click interaction that launches a bot response.

## Design Decisions

### Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js + Tailwind CSS
- **Chat Experience:** Utilize React state management (`useState`) to manage message flows.
- **Mock LLM Behavior:** Integrated `setTimeout()` to mimic bot thinking time delay.
- **Future-Proofing:** Seamless extensibility to integrate actual LLMs such as OpenAI through Langchain or API.

### UI Decisions
- Clean design with focus on clarity and contrast.
- Chat bubble style for easy differentiation between user and bot.
- Floating widget with expand/collapse feature to prevent intrusiveness.

### API Handling (Optional)
- Ready-to-use OpenAI API integration included (commented for fallback handling).
- Can be enabled for real-time LLM interaction if a valid API key is provided.
